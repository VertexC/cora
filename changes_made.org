* Decoupling of loop and index variables
  In compute and placeholder ops, for now, we have decoupled the loop
  iteration variables from the tensor indices.

* Changing the semantics of cache_write
  Due to the aforementioned decoupling of loop iteration variables and
  tensor index variables, CacheWrite does not perform layout
  transforms. Instead tensor layout transdforms can be implemented in
  a new scheduling primitive. As an aside, as CacheWrite does not
  perform layput transforms now, it is recommended to apply it before
  any further scheduling is performed.

* CacheReadOpaque
