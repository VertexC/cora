- Adding support for multiple loops generated for scans. This is
  useful for the case of trees with a variable number of children per
  node. This can be done by marking the additional loops to be
  generated (apart from the scan axis which is currently generated)
  not opaque, as all the spatial axis currently are.

- Support for specializations in scans: essentially adding an envelope
  scan operation, that manages the specialized implementations of the
  scan.

- Data structure dependency aware barrier placement.
