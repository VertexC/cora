- Find a suitable place for lowering ragged tensor accesses in the
  presence of storage scheduling. Currently the function is
  implemented in tensor_layout_utils.cc
- IterVars in reduce nodes are often rewritten during expression
  rewrites/replacements, which puts them out of sync with the leaf
  iter vars stored in stages as the latter ones aren't updated during
  expression rewrites. Currently, we mutate the range of the iter var
  when mutating a ReduceNode in expr_functor, which is a bad bad
  hack. Maybe we should only store the ranges and the variables in
  ReduceNode and not the reduce_axis?
